In [my recent post for freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-vue-composables-work/), I looked at how Vue Composables can be used to simplify and reuse stateful logic across your Vue 3 applications. While the documentation covers things well, I dive a little deeper with some examples that demonstrate:

- Why composables are essential for DRY code in modern Vue apps
- A simple counter composable implementation to understand the fundamentals
- A more complex `useAsyncState` composable for robust API request handling
- Real-world usage patterns with proper TypeScript typing

I hope you enjoy the post. Let me know on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrowbrian/) or [BlueSky]() what you think!
