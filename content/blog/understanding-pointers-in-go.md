I recently wrote a post for freeCodeCamp that breaks down pointers in
Goâ€”especially with JavaScript developers in mind. If you've ever felt like
pointers were a bit of a mystery, this oneâ€™s for you.

I cover:

- What pointers actually are (and how they're different from regular variables)
- How to use `*` and `&` in Go
- Why pointer receivers matter when working with methods
- Common pitfalls like `nil` pointers

Let me know what you thinkâ€”or if anything's still fuzzy!
